============================================
Welcome to django-authority's documentation!
============================================

django-authority is a powerful layer between Django's basic permission system
(provided through ``django.contrib.auth``) and your application:

.. image:: .static/authority-scheme-layer.png

This application provides three abilities:

1. It gives you the ability to add permissions like Django's generic
   permissions to any kind of model without having to add them to the model's
   Meta class.

2. It provides a very simple way to create per-object-permissions. You might
   be more familiar with the term *row level permissions*.

3. It wraps Django's generic permissions so you can use the same syntax as
   for the options above. But note that django-authority does not add any
   voodoo-code to Django's ``contrib.auth`` system, it keeps your existing
   permission system intact!

django-authority uses a cache that is stored on the user object to help improve
performance. However, if the ``Permission`` table changes the cache will need
to be invalidated. More information about this can be found in the tips and
tricks section.

.. warning:: We have just started with the documentation and it's far from
   being perfect. If you find glitches, errors or just have feedback, please
   contact the team: :ref:`support`.
