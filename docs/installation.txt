Installation
============

The installation of django-authority is easy. Whether you want to use the
latest stable or development version, you have the following options.

The latest stable version
=========================

The latest, stable version is always available via the `Python package index_`
(PyPI). You can download the latest version on `the site`_ but most users
would prefer either ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::

    pip install django-authority

    # .. or with easy_install:

    easy_install django-authority

.. _the site: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-authority/
.. _Python package index: http://pypi.python.org/pypi

Development version
===================

The latest development version is located on it's `Bitbucket account`_. You
can checkout the package using the Mercurial_ scm::

    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-authority/

Then install it manually::

    cd django-authority
    python setup.py install

.. warning:: The development version is not fully tested and may contain
    bugs, so we prefer to use the latest package from pypi.
